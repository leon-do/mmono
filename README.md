## Design

What is a 20 mm edge?

For a 90¬∞ angle, it‚Äôs simple.

For a perfect 90¬∞ angle, it‚Äôs simple‚Äîthe distance (shown in red) is exactly 20 mm.

But a 90¬∞ edge is harsh on the skin. Sharp edges concentrate stress at a single point, increasing pain and the chance of skin splitting. That‚Äôs why all popular hangboards have rounded edges, called fillets in CAD.

> **Edge Fillet:** A smooth, curved surface with a constant radius that rounds off a sharp corner or transition between two intersecting faces.

Fillets are usually described by their **Edge Radius** ‚Äî the larger the radius, the rounder the edge.

Unfortunately, there is no universal fillet radius for hangboards. Many manufacturers vary this (typically 3-10mm). Different brands use different edge radii:

Where there is a fillet, the effective edge depth changes. What counts as ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù depth (red lines)?

This might sound negligible, but millimeters matter for climbers.

To objectively define a true edge depth, we must agree on some definitions:

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6e96257-e4d4-4457-a92b-3dfff37607fa)

- **Total Depth:** The total depth, ignoring edge radius (90¬∞ diagram)  
- **Edge Radius:** The measurement of a curved edge  
- **Effective Length:** The usable length along its surface  
- **Ineffective Length:** The unusable length along its surface  
- **Effective Depth:** The usable depth of the edge  

Since there's no standard definition of Effective Length and Depth, the goal is to propose a mathematically *ok-ish* definition.

For a 90¬∞ angle, it‚Äôs simple. The red line is the usable edge. Your fingers hang there. The blue line is the unusable edge. Your fingers cannot hang there.

For a perfect right angle, the tangent of the corner is undefined, but if there's a small radius (0.01 mm), the tangent gradually transitions from horizontal to vertical, with the midway point at 45¬∞. 

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9680e3ed-768c-46f0-bcdc-8d5a6fec6073)

Based on this, we can define the **Effective Length** as the distance along the edge up to this midway point of the fillet.

Now that Effective Length is defined, we can calculate **Effective Depth**.

Use the unit circle as a reference.

Given Edge Radius & Effective Depth, calculate Total Depth:

```
Set edge_radius (blue) = 8mm
Set effective_depth (dotted) = 20mm

Solve for total_depth (green)

red_line = cos(45) * 8mm
pink_line = edge_radius - red_line

total_depth = effective_depth + pink_line
green = dotted + pink
```

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3e8c50-2f41-404b-9bdf-484f69bc2153)

A one line equation

```
total_depth = effective_depth + (edge_radius * (1 - cos(45))

total_depth = effective_depth + (edge_radius * (1 - 0.5 ** 0.5))
```

Python

```python
import math

effective_depth = 20

edge_radius = 8

total_depth = effective_depth + (edge_radius * (1 - 0.5 ** 0.5))

print(total_depth)
# total_depth = 22.34314575050762
```

Finally, use calculated Total Depth to extrude your mono

Then create your Fillet Radius.

**Conclusion:**  
A **22.343 mm deep mono + 8 mm fillet radius** gives exactly **20 mm effective edge depth**.
